            Fourteen-year-old Alfred Cutler is living on the family
            sheep ranch in the woods during the late nineteenth century.
            One day, his pa comes home with distressing newsâ€”a large pack
            of wolves has come to the area, spreading fear throughout the
            rural community of Dunborough. Pa is worried his flock is in
            danger because he has not finished the new fold yet. Will they
            be able to protect the family sheep against this four-footed,
            blood-thirsty band of marauders?
