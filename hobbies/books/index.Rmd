Here, Alfred Cutler: The Backwoods Boy will be displayed on a card. Once clicked, the card will take the user to the appropriate HTML file. 

Other stories will be added here, as well. In addition to a description of each story, there will be a *HISTORY* tab, describing any background information which the reader may find interesting.
